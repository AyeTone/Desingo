### What I learned

While completing this project I learned something on the more basic side
but still very useful. I learned how to change my background images without creating a complex JavaScript function. I was unaware that the reason that-

```
.class {
  background-image: url('../../assets/picture.png');
}
```

would not work because of the stucturing of the file even though the emmet led me there. Since I'm using sass w/ gulp and how it set up so that all of my scss files get converted and combined all into one css file on the top level, I could access the assests by doing-

```
.class {
  background-image: url('assets/picture.png');
}
```

instead. Like I said, something really simple that I'm glad I learned it.
